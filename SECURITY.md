- ✅ CSP (Content Security Policy)
- ✅ CORS configuration

### 🔍 Input Validation
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Input sanitization

### 📊 Monitoring

## Security Headers

```typescript
// Implemented in server/middleware/security-headers.ts

headers: {
  'X-Frame-Options': 'SAMEORIGIN',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'",
  'Referrer-Policy': 'no-referrer-when-downgrade',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
}
```

---

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
```
100 requests/minute per IP (general)
10 requests/minute for auth endpoints
1000 requests/hour for authenticated users
```

### API Key Management
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ Never commit keys to git
- ✅ Separate keys for dev/prod

### Token Security
```typescript
// JWT Configuration
{
  algorithm: 'HS256',
  expiresIn: '15m', // Access token
  refreshExpiresIn: '7d' // Refresh token
}
```

- ✅ At least 1 uppercase letter
- ✅ At least 1 lowercase letter
- ✅ At least 1 number
- ✅ At least 1 special character

### Best Practices
